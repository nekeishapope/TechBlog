              Oracle database SQL note is very much straight forward. You do not
              need to purchase any sql or PL/SQL books in my opinion. The oracle
              nates is free on the Oracle website to download for free. SQL is
              one of the easiest Language you can learn in computer programming
              so no need to purchase expensive book to start querying.

              This book explains the importance of well written and organized

              to read code that is not written by you. Companies has lost
              countless of resources due to poorly written code. understanding
              the concept of writing organize code will not only improve your
              skills as a programmer, it will save time rewriting code that
              perform the same task. It explains why you should use descriptive
              names when naming variables and functions, the concepts of writing
              a function, and some other useful points.
