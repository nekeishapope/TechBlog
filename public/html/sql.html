            <span id="select"> select * from table_name;</span>

            from indicates which table to retrieve the data from.
            and table_name specifies the name of the table.

            Select colum_name from table_name;

            <span>select first_name from employees;</span>
        </p>

        <p>To select multiple column from a table:
            select column_1, column_2 from table_name; <br>
            you must use comma to separate the names of the columns

            <span>select first_name, last_name from employees; </span>
        </p>
