            <h1>MAC VS WINDOWS(PC)</h1>
            <p>
                When it comes to computer programing, Mac and Windows has its advantages and disadvantages. Both
                computers are useful based on the path you are taking
                in computer programing. For instance, if you want to develop an IOS app, you will most definitely need
                an apple computer. Whereas, if you want to
                develop an Android app, it's best to purchase a Window computer. However, if you are solely into web
                development, the operating system does not matter since
                visual studio code works on both Mac and Windows operating systems.
                <br><br>
                Both system performs great under extensive use.  But, they are not the same when it comes
                to productivity. When it comes to productivity it prefer using MAC over Window as a computer programmer.
                Why?

                Programing softwares like code blocks, git bash, SQL developer or eclipse, may require
                separate drivers in order for the program to run smoothly on a windows machine.
                Whereas, on a Mac, you do not need any separate divers in order to use the program as designed.
                At times you may have to disable a graphics card in order for the program to run efficiently on a windows computer.

                  <h1>MAC FEATURES</h1>
                <img class="best-OS-pic" src="/images/macOS.jpg" alt="">
                <p>1. Mac can be partitioned to run Windows OS by either Virtual Machine or Boot Camp. So, that mean you 
                    can booth in either MAC OS or WINDOWS OS <br><br>
                    <hr>
                   2. Mac is UNIX-based thus more developer-friendly. Which means you can run ANY programming language on your system
                                        <span>C, </span>
                                        <span>C++, </span>
                                        <span>SQL DEVELOPER, </span>
                                        <span>PYTHON, </span>
                                        <span>Java. plus more. </span><br><br>
                   <hr>
                   3. Mac Terminal (CLI) allows you to fully control your system. 
                   The Command-Line editing that can be 
                   customize to function like a text editor. <br>
                   You have the ability to run "if/then", "for" loops right on the command line. 
                   You can also give input/output as arguments to another command. 
                    <br><br>

                   4. The BIGEST reason why i love use macOS over Windows is the DRIVERS issue.  
                   Most of the programming softwares i've download to on my MAC was ready for use once the download has completed
                   Not so easy when is comes to windows.

              <img class="best-OS-pic" src="/images/windowsOS.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Windows can not be partitioned to run MAC OS.  Although, you can rent a MAC in the cloud(macincloud)
                    it will not be as stable and macOS built-in on a machine.
                    <br><br>
                    <hr>
                    You will need to download programs like GitBash, JDK package, and even configure the path on your PC in order for the
                    programming language to compile. <br><br>
                    <hr>
                    Windows uses Command Prompt or Powershell which is very limited and most of the abilities you have while using MAC Terminal does not exist on WINDOWS.<br><br>
                   <hr>
                    Window required some configuration after downloading some programing softwares.  For instance<br>
                    If programs like:
                               
          <ul>
                    <li>Eclipse: You will have to download a separate package AND configure the paths for JDK</li>
                    <li>SQL developer: You will have to configure the bin folder to input the .dll file.</li>
                    <li>GitBash: You may require to download MinGW(A compiler system that allow you run GNU(GCC) compiler. ) in order to run C/C++ programs. 
                </ul>
                </p>
