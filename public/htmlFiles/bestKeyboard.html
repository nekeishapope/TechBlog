                <p>
                    Apple magic keyboard is number 5 on the list because of it's compatibility. It limited
                    to windows users and the touch id is only dedicated to M1 MAC'S.   
                    Typing feels great, and offer good tactile feedback.  However, there is no back-lighting
                    on the keyboard for coder who want to code at night. 
                    It is a solid keyboard that will last years with great battery life.
                    A single charge can last you anywhere from 5-6 months on heavy coding.

                <p>
                    Das Keyboard 4 Professional is an exceptionally constructed Mechanical keyboard for programmers.
                    It is made well, it feels great, solid, and considered premium.  It comes with cherry MX switches that gives you
                    an experience while typing.  It is a full size keyboard, with the option for Windows or Linux users.  
                    However, if you are using MAC OS I highly recommend getting the mac version because, the Windows version 
                    does not work well on MAC OS.
