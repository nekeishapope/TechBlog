        This book is one of the greatest books to prepare yourself for programming interview.  It is well written 
        and it is aimed to prepare programmers for interviews for Companies like Apple, Uber, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.
        It is written by the same author who wrote ALGORITHM FOR INTERVIEW.  It covers topic like data structures, algorithms, coding, and problems-solving.

 <h1 class="book-name">2. CRACKING THE CODING INTERVIEW BY GAYLE LAAKMANN MCDOWELL</h1>
<div class="grid"> 
       <img class="books" src="../images/crackingcodinginterview.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>
            This is one of the most read book in the programming world.  It cover interview questions from different
            programming languages with great practice questions.  This book is a bit dated but it is very well used 
            by big Companies in the tech industries. I recommend this book because the author "Gayle Laakmann" has worked with well known
            companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft.

<div class="grid">
    <img class="books" src="../images/PROGINTEREXP.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
   This book explain the pros and cons of problem solving approach. It explained in details important topics like 
   puzzles, string, array, coding, algorithms, binary trees, networking, computer science, etc. This book is a great 
   refresher for basic programming concepts.  The puzzles was very interactive.

     <h1 class="book-name">4. DAILY CODING PROBLEMS BY ALEX MILLER AND LAWRENCE WU</h1>
<div class="grid">
    <img class="books" src="../images/dailyCodingProblems.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>
        Beyond the small text, this book is very under-rated.  You do not hear nor see a lot of programmers talking 
        about or reviewing this book.  I had the opportunity to read through it and I was not a bad book.  It has code 
        problem solving question that was not to difficult which you can find on leet code.  I recommend this book to 
        a beginner who is looking for a Junior role.

    <h1 class="book-name">5. THE ALGORITHM DESIGN MANUAL BY STEVEN S. SKIENA</h1>
<div class="grid"> 
    <img class="books" src="../images/ALGODESMAN-INTERVIEW.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>
        This book contains questions based on algorithms and data structures. It is one of the best book you can
        read on algorithms in order to ace the toughest interview questions. The book focuses more on practical implementations
        of algorithms than leaning algorithms but needless to say if the author assumes that you may have some experience 
        with algorithms and data structures hance the reason why you're reading books that prepares you for interviews.
