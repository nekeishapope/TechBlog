        A Programmer's job require a lot of focus and can be very challenging.
        So, surrounding yourself with the best possible gadgets will keep you
        healthy and increase productivity. It does not matter if you are working

          <p>
            Rubik Cube is one of the best gadgets you can have on your computer
            desk. Rubik Cube helped train and strengthen the brain cell. Not
            only that this piece of gadget can on turn your thinking light on is
            also helps ease the tension for coding. As a programmer, we gets
            frustrated when our code is not compiling or giving the output as we
            wanted. It is necessary to relax the brain but stepping away from
            the computer

          <p>
            Hour glass is another great gadget to keep on your desk. Use an hour
            glass if you want to train yourself to code within a specific time.
            For instance, if your are learning a new programing Language try
            coding a small project before the sand is empty from the upper bulb.

            If you are a web developer or planing to go into web development I
            highly suggest that you take up the hobbies of being a PHOTOGRAPHER.
            In order to have visitors to stay on your page it must be
            interactive, and must have a reason for the visitors to stay. And,
            the best way to keep visitors on you website you must have Pictures.
            Even if you are building a website for clients it is always best to
            have you own photos than to use someone elses photos online.

            Programmers!! Please take care of your health. It is the most
            important trait to have as a computer programmer. Take a break
            sometimes to engage in some type of mindfulness. You can purchase a
            fitbit or an apple watch to track your fitness and wellness. The
            fitness apps made for these watches are great. Wether if it is
            jogging, breathing, or mindfulness, please take sometime of coding
            for health and wellness.

            Weather you are into music or high frequency vibration sound to

            recommend getting a noise cancellation headphones enhance you of
            music. Not only will you enjoy great sound but you will also enjoy
            not hearing noisy family members or outside sound.

            As a programmer, we are constantly think about the next big ideas
            for website, projects and apps! Most of this ideas vanish within an
            hour, the best practice is to write down your ideas. And I highly
            recommend reusable paper. The ROCKETBOOK SMART NOTEBOOK is a very
            inexpensive gadget and completely reusable. Once you are done with a
            page, yon can scan it using the app and then wipe the down off for
            next use.

            LED lights brings relaxation and coziness to your coding space. You
            can purchase some inexpensive lights on amazon for about $15-50 and
            stick it on the back of you computer desk. A nice interchangeable
            colors to match your mood would make your coding session much more

            When sitting at a computer desk for a long period of time, it is
            very important that you make sure that the blood circulate through
            your foot properly. Footrest also help reduce back strain, pressure
            on the legs, reduce fatigue, and ease pain or discomfort in the
            feet, ankles, and knees.
