        it's a well written, well structured book.  It talks about all the topic you need to know 
        to designed a webpage. The reason why i love this book when it comes to web development is, 
        it is not over populated with unnecessary text and it gets straight to point with each and every topic.
        another reason why i love this book is you get a visual presentation of what every elements, tags, variables class, id's does 
        by using pictures. <br><br>
